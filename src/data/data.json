Our infrastructure included an MS Exchange on-premises server, a Windows server, and a mix of Windows and Linux machines. A key achievement in this role was installing Linux machines and successfully integrating them with the Windows server. This allowed users to access the ERP systems hosted on the Windows server with different user accounts, thereby saving the organization from purchasing additional Windows licenses.",
